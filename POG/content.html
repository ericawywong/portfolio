            <h1 id="title">POG: Building Structure and Identity for Internal SaaS Tools</h1>
            <p>POG (short for ‚ÄúPot of Gold‚Äù) is part of an internal suite of SaaS tools developed for airG‚Äôs Sales and Marketing teams. The name started as an inside joke ‚Äî a lighthearted placeholder that stuck ‚Äî but the product itself served a serious purpose: to bring clarity, efficiency, and consistency to internal operations.
            </p>
            <p>POG was originally built from a legacy tool that had become overly complicated, visually inconsistent, and difficult to navigate. I partnered with a Product Manager to reimagine its structure, interface, and identity ‚Äî designing both the branding and an entirely new design system to simplify workflows and unify the experience across the suite.</p>

            <h2 id="challenge">Challenge: Clarity Within Chaos</h2>
            <p>
              When we evaluated existing design systems, we found that they were:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Overly complicated</strong> ‚Äî too many variations and edge cases we didn‚Äôt need.</li>
              <li><strong>Poorly structured</strong> ‚Äî difficult to find and organize relevant components.</li>
              <li><strong>Mismatched</strong> ‚Äî many styles and components simply didn‚Äôt fit our products.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The result? Slower design, more inconsistencies, and unnecessary rework during dev handoff.</p>

                <p>
                  Instead of trying to adapt to an off-the-shelf system, we asked: ‚ÄúWhat if we just designed for ourselves?‚Äù</p> 
                  <p>We realized that:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>A simplified, custom system would speed up design and reduce clutter.</li>
                    <li>Categorizing components more clearly would make it easier for designers and developers to find what they need.</li>
                    <li>Spacing, variables, and tokens could provide consistency at scale while reducing revisions during QA.</li>
                    <li>A lighter system meant less overhead, keeping our focus on delivering value for the Sales and Marketing teams.</li>
