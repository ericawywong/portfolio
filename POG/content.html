            <h1 id="title">POG: Building Structure and Identity for Internal SaaS Tools</h1>
            <p>POG (short for <i>“Pot of Gold”</i>) is part of an internal suite of SaaS tools developed for airG’s <strong>Sales and Marketing teams</strong>. The name started as an inside joke — a lighthearted placeholder that stuck — but the product itself served a serious purpose: <strong>to bring clarity, efficiency, and consistency to internal operations.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>POG was originally built from a legacy tool that had become overly complicated, visually inconsistent, and difficult to navigate. I partnered with a Product Manager to <strong>reimagine its structure, interface, and identity</strong> — designing both the branding and an entirely new design system to simplify workflows and unify the experience across the suite.</p>

            <h2 id="challenge">Challenge: Clarity Within Chaos</h2>
            <p>
              POG, while powerful in function, had grown into a tool that was just as intimidating as it was essential.
            </p>

            <section class="section" aria-labelledby="users">
            <h3>Our Users</h3>
            <p><strong>Primary Users:</strong> Internal marketing and sales specialists.</p>
            <p>They knew their workflow inside out — from creating acquisitions to tracking campaign performance — but they struggled with the tool’s complexity and lack of structure.</p>
            <p><strong>New Users:</strong> Anyone onboarding into the system for the first time faced a steep learning curve. Without proper documentation or guided flows, new team members often relied on colleagues to “teach them the ropes,” making onboarding inconsistent and inefficient.</p>

              <h3>The Existing Problem</h3>
              <p>Over time, POG had evolved without a unified design direction. Every update solved a small problem — but collectively, it created a maze.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Overly complicated UI</strong> — too many components, too little consistency.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of branding</strong> — Pot of Gold was just a placeholder name with no visual identity or personality.</li>
                <li><strong>Developer overwhelm</strong> — custom UI elements were difficult to build, maintain, and reuse.</li>
                <li><strong>No system thinking</strong> — each fix addressed an isolated issue, leaving no foundation for scalability.</li>

              <h3>System-Level Challenge</h3>
              <quote>We weren’t just designing one tool — we were building the framework for every internal tool that would follow.</quote>
              <p>POG wasn’t a standalone product — it was part of a growing suite of internal tools, including Ad Management, Localization systems and more.</p>
              <p>If we didn’t solve its structural and design inefficiencies at a system level, the chaos would multiply across the entire suite.</p>

                <h4>Understanding the Legacy Tool</h4>
                <p>We began with a deep dive into the existing POG interface — and it didn’t take long to realize the problem.</p>
                <p>The tool was cluttered, difficult to navigate, and lacked any sense of visual identity.</p>
                <p>👉 Solution: Focus on simplification.</p>
                <p>We stripped the UI down to its essentials, reorganized the workflow, and started mapping what a lightweight design system could look like for our internal needs.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="section" aria-labelledby="design-solutions">
                <h4>Building a Tailored Design System</h4>
                <p>We didn’t need an all-encompassing design library with hundreds of components — we needed something lean, specific, and easy to maintain.</p>
                <p>👉 Solution: I built a custom design system that included:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Clear typography and hierarchy</li>
                  <li>Simplified spacing and layout rules</li>
                  <li>A consistent color palette</li>
                  <li>A core set of reusable components (tables, forms, modals, buttons)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This not only sped up design and handoff but also reduced the number of errors during development. It helped us <strong>move fast without breaking consistency</strong>.</p>

                <section class="section" aria-labelledby="design-challenges">
                <h4>Branding Decisions</h4>
                <p>Then came the fun part — branding.</p>
                <p>While “Pot of Gold” naturally suggested gold and yellow, those colors weren’t practical for UI accessibility. I wanted a metaphor that felt playful yet professional.</p>
                <p>I drew inspiration from product suites like Google Workspace, Microsoft Office, and Adobe Creative Cloud — systems we use daily that maintain individuality within a shared identity.</p> 
                <p>I chose the green of the Canadian $20 bill, one of the most commonly used bills in Canada. The color represents growth, stability, and familiarity, making it a perfect metaphor for an internal tool that supports performance and progress.</p>
                <p>👉 Solution: Built an agile brand identity — flexible enough to evolve, but strong enough to feel real.</p>
                <p> Later, I experimented with logo concepts that visualized both the “pot” and “gold” ideas in a clean, geometric form.</p>

                <h4>Development Pivot</h4>
                <p>Halfway through, our development team hit a wall.</p>
                <p>The number of custom UI components needed for POG was overwhelming — and progress began to slow.</p>
                <p>👉 Solution: We pivoted to use the Angular component library and Tailwind CSS framework.</p>
                <p>This change improved:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Development speed</strong> — pre-built components meant faster implementation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consistency</strong> — standardized styles reduced discrepancies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintainability</strong> — easier to update and scale in the future.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It was the perfect balance between custom design control and framework efficiency.</p>

                <section class="section" aria-labelledby="scaling-challenges">
                <h4>Scaling Beyond POG</h4>
                <p>POG was part of a broader internal SaaS suite that also included tools like Ad Management and Localization.</p>
                <p> To keep the ecosystem cohesive, we needed a unifying visual language — while allowing each product to maintain its own identity.</p>
                <p>👉 Solution: Inspired by Microsoft Office Suite, each tool was assigned its own theme color but remained connected through a shared design system, layout structure, and iconography.</p>
                <p>This approach brought visual harmony and functional consistency across all products.</p>

                <h4>Prioritization</h4>
                <p>At the start, the team often found themselves buried in feature discussions — the tool’s complexity made it easy to lose sight of priorities.</p>
                <p>👉 Solution: We embraced agile design thinking.</p>
                <p>To meet tight timelines, I created “quick UI passes” — simplified, functional mockups that gave developers something to build on early, while leaving room for iterative polish later.</p>
                <p>This approach kept momentum high without sacrificing design intent — allowing the product to grow in layers rather than in chaos.</p>
