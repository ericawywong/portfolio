                <h2>A clinically proven application for screening early stages of Alzheimer's</h2>
                <p>BrainTest is an empirically validated application designed for the early screening of Alzheimer's, a chronic and irreversible condition that impacts memory, thinking, and behavior. While traditionally associated with those aged 65 and over, research indicates that symptoms can manifest at earlier ages. BrainTest aids doctors in identifying the onset of Alzheimer's symptoms, offering peace of mind to those concerned about potential diagnoses in their loved ones. In the early stages, symptoms may be subtle or minimal, making the test a valuable resource for reassurance.</p>

                <h2>Interactive Guide</h2>
                <p>Understanding that Alzheimer's is a sensitive subject, we aimed to create a design that balances professionalism with a light-hearted, approachable feel. To achieve this, we developed a series of colorful infographics and illustrations that effectively convey various scenarios related to Alzheimer's while maintaining a sense of trustworthiness. Additionally, we crafted interactive questions to engage users, enhancing their experience through thoughtful design.</p>
                <p>The animations were created in After Effects and implemented using the Lottie plugin, ensuring they are fully responsive without compromising image quality. This approach allowed for seamless integration of micro-animations, enhancing user interactivity and creating a more engaging and visually appealing interface.

                <h2>The future plan...</h2>
                <p>If I were to enhance the interactive guide, I would redesign it using Rive. This would allow us to create fully animated and interactive experiences with minimal developer time and resources while maintaining complete control over animations and interactions for impressive results. Additionally, I would increase the number of pop-up questions throughout the guide to boost user engagement, making the experience more dynamic and engaging.</p>

                <h2>Design System & Component Library</h2>
                <p>In 2015, BrainTest's design process began in Photoshop. As our team grew, we transitioned to Sketch Cloud, allowing all designers easy access to the most up-to-date files and eliminating the need for constant interruptions.</p>
                <p>Recognizing the inconsistencies across various designers' files and versions, I took the initiative to build a comprehensive design library for BrainTest. This centralized library not only ensured cohesive and efficient mockups by standardizing components but also streamlined communication between designers and developers by finalizing naming conventions for elements and icons.</p>
