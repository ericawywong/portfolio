            <p>
              <strong>MovieBitez</strong> is a concept project developed as part of my <strong>Google UX Design certification course</strong>, where I worked through the full process — from <strong>user research and UX design to final UI and prototyping</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>As a product, MovieBitez is a mobile app that lets moviegoers order food and drinks directly to their seats.</p>
            <p>No more lines. No awkward mid-movie exits.</p>
            <p>Just comfort, convenience, and popcorn on demand.</p>

            <h3>Background Story</h3>
            <p>Before I began, I had a scenario from my own experience.</p>
            <p>I’ve settled comfortably into my recliner, excited for the movie. The lights dim, the trailers roll — and suddenly, the smell of buttery popcorn hits me. Then comes the crunch of chips from behind me.</p>
            <p><strong>Instant regret.</strong></p>
            <p>I didn’t get snacks — and now I’m stuck in the middle of the row, torn between squeezing past everyone or trying to get over it.</p>
            <p>That’s when I thought:</p>
            <quote>“In daily life, we have apps like <strong>Uber Eats</strong> and <strong>SkipTheDishes</strong> that make getting food as simple as a tap on our phones. So why not bring that same convenience to the movie theatre?”</quote>

            <h2 id="challenge">Challenge: Convenience Shouldn’t Be Complicated</h2>
            <p>
              After chatting with a few friends and reading online research from forums, I discovered that while VIP theatres promise comfort, <strong>the in-seat dining experience was still old-fashioned and disruptive</strong>.
            </p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
            <h3>Key pain points</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Guest Discomfort</strong> - Ordering food became awkward for seated guests, especially those in the middle of rows or with limited mobility. This discouraged spontaneous purchases and lowered overall concession sales, showing a clear need for a more seamless, in-seat solution.</li>
                <li><strong>User Strain</strong> - Guests navigated tight aisles in dim lighting while carrying food and drinks — stressful and inconvenient.</li>
                <li><strong>Skip the Line (or Lack Thereof)</strong> - Unlike other entertainment or dining experiences, there was no convenient way to <strong>order ahead or skip the concession line</strong>. This led to long queues before showtimes — often causing guests to miss previews or delay purchases altogether.</li>

                <p>The <strong>MovieBitez food ordering app</strong> will let users order food in-theatre quickly and easily.</p>
                <p>This benefits <strong>tired workers and parents</strong> by allowing them to stay seated, save time, and enjoy the movie while their food is handled.</p>

                 We already have <strong>Uber Eats, SkipTheDishes, and DoorDash</strong> for everyday food delivery — designed for users who are actively engaging with their devices in open, social environments.
                </p>
                <p>But a movie theatre is completely different.</p>
                <p>It’s a closed, quiet space where every sound, every light, and every distraction matters.</p>
                <p>Guests want <strong>convenience without interruption.</strong></p>
                <p>Staff want <strong>efficiency without friction.</strong></p>

              <h3>Colors</h3>
              <p>I designed the app using a dark theme to accommodate the low-light environment of a theatre. This approach helps reduce eye strain and minimizes screen brightness, allowing users to browse and order without disrupting others around them.</p>
              <p>The color palette combines deep navy blues — echoing the glow of a theatre screen — with a warm gold accent that evokes a sense of leisure, comfort, and subtle luxury. Together, they create a balanced visual experience that feels both immersive and elegant, perfectly suited for a cinematic atmosphere.</p>

              <h3>Typography:</h3>
              <p>To maintain visual clarity and consistency, I limited the typography to five variations across the entire app. The type hierarchy was designed to balance readability and hierarchy in a dark environment:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Large, bold headers guide users quickly through key sections like Menu, Combos, and My Orders.</li>
                <li>Medium-weight subheaders distinguish food categories and pricing for effortless scanning.</li>
                <li>Body text remains legible at smaller sizes, using high contrast for accessibility.</li>
                <li>Buttons and labels use concise, sentence-style text for clarity and ease of interaction.</li>

              <h3>Components</h3>

              <p>I also defined key interaction states — Enabled, Hover, Pressed, and Disabled — to provide clear visual feedback and improve the overall user experience.</p>
              <p>I also included a range of cards and modal variations to support different functions within the app, featuring item images, names, and prices for quick recognition.</p>
              <p>These standardized elements not only improved design consistency but also made development and future updates more scalable.</p>

              <p>MovieBitez showed me that <strong>innovation isn’t always about invention</strong> — sometimes it’s about <strong>adapting convenience to context</strong>.</p>
              <p><i>It’s not “Uber Eats for theatres.”</i></p>
              <p> It’s about designing <strong>a seamless, silent experience</strong> that enhances comfort and keeps users immersed in the moment.</p>
              <p>Because sometimes, the best UX is the one that lets you stay fully in the moment — popcorn smell and all. 🍿</p>
