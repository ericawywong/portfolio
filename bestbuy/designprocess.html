                <h2>The original design process</h2>
                <p>It was introduced to me as a <span class="bold">"simple" process</span> where the merchandisers will submit product info and copies to us 2 weeks priror to launch.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">In the "everything is prefect" scenioro,</span> we would simply plug in the content and send it off to localization and our outsourcing agent for implemenentation.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Things didn't go as planned.</span> We begin to expereice spotonaious and large amount of edits scattered in different emails, text, calls and time frames.</p>

                <h2>Refined design process</h2>
                <p>I proposed a <span class="bold">two-week process</span> featuring only <span class="bold">two deadlines</span>.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">In the initial week,</span> inventory merchandisers submitted their products, copies, and prices to designers for mockups. Stakeholders will provide their edits during an in-person review meeting.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">A final round of review will be conducted online,</span> and copies will be sent for localization. Subsequently, all essential assets will be forwarded to the outsourcing team for development.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">An online proofing tool was introduced</span> to keep all comments in one place. Any edits submitted outside of the tool was prohibited.</p>

                <h2>The challanges</h2>
                <h3>Connect with everyone</h3>
                <p>The number of memebers that are involved in creating one e-newsletter was surprisingly large, including: the project mangers, product marchandisers for each of the categories, the art directors, the copywriters and the designers.</p>
                <h3>Retrospacs</h3>
                <p>When this was first introduced, we have a lot of set backs where a lot of the stakeholders were too used to the original process and having a hard time adjusting.
                    <p>In order to reinforcsed this process, when there are a last min request, we will keep track of all the edits and have a retrospec meeting every 2 cycles.</p>
                    <p>This process was exteremly impactful as it lays out the reasons for the edits and evulate if they are neccessary and essentally elimates the unnesscary ones.</p>

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Successfully reduced production costs</li>
                    <li>Enhanced overall team efficiency</li>
                    <li>Last min edits, unforuntualy, are still unavoidable (since we are only human); however, the
                        number of these edits have drastically decreased.</li>
                    <li>Edits and comments are kept in one place; therefore, elimated overlooked requests.</li>
                    <li>A less stressful working enovirment for all fellow teammates üòÅ</li>
