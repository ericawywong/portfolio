                <h2>The original design process</h2>
                <p>Initially, the process seemed straightforward: merchandisers would submit product information and copies two weeks before launch.</p>
                <p>In an ideal scenario, we would simply integrate the content and send it off for localization and implementation by our outsourcing agent.</p>
                <p>However, we soon encountered numerous spontaneous edits scattered across emails, texts, calls, and various time frames.

            <div class="start-4-span-6 m-start-3-span-8 s-start-2-span-10">
                <p>As the team expanded, the need for streamlined processes became increasingly critical. I noticed that designers often faced challenges with last-minute edits, which created a stressful environment and increased costs due to frequent revisions submitted to the outsourcing agency.</p>

                <h2>Refined design process</h2>
                <p>To address this, I proposed a two-week process with only two deadlines.</p> 
                <p>In the first week, inventory merchandisers would submit their products, copies, and prices to designers for mockups. Stakeholders would provide their edits during an in-person review meeting.</p> 
                <p>A final review would be conducted online, and copies would be sent for localization. Finally, all essential assets would be forwarded to the outsourcing team for development.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">An online proofing tool was introduced</span> to keep all comments in one place. Any edits submitted outside of the tool was prohibited.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="start-4-span-6 m-start-3-span-8 s-start-2-span-10">
                <h2>The challanges</h2>
                <h3>Connect with everyone</h3>
                <p>The number of members involved in creating one e-newsletter was surprisingly large, including project managers, product merchandisers for each category, art directors, copywriters, and designers.</p>
                <h3>Retrospacs</h3>
                <p>When this new process was introduced, we faced setbacks as many stakeholders were accustomed to the original process and struggled to adjust.</p> 
                <p>To reinforce the new process, we tracked all edits and held retrospective meetings every two e-newsletters.</p>
                <p>This approach was highly effective as it identified the reasons for edits, evaluated their necessity, and eliminated unnecessary ones.</p>

                    <li>Enhanced overall team efficiency</li>
