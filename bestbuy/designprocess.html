                    <h1>Case Study: <br> Streamlining Design Handoff for E-Newsletters</h1>
                    <p>When I joined the newly formed team as the sole designer, I adopted the existing workflow after consulting with the project manager, creative leadership, marketing, and merchandisers. It was the process everyone was familiar with.</p>
                    <p>However, as our workload increased, cracks in the system began to show—especially around misaligned communication, inconsistent feedback, and repeated last-minute revisions.</p>

                    <h2>🔍 Challenge: Fragmented Feedback & Rising Costs</h2>
                    <p>What began as a straightforward process—merchandisers submitting content two weeks before launch—became disorganized and reactive. Designers were inundated with edit requests via email, chat, and ad-hoc calls, often overlapping with final development.</p>

                            <p>Observing the chaos, I realized that without centralized communication and enforced deadlines, the design process would remain reactive and expensive. The root issue wasn’t creativity—it was the lack of structure around it.</p>
                            <p>With multiple departments involved—project managers, merchandisers, copywriters, developers, and designers—we needed a shared framework that enforced consistency, accountability, and clarity.</p>

                            <p>I introduced a structured two-week process with two fixed edit windows, supported by an online proofing tool to house all feedback in one place.</p> 
                            <h3>Week 1: Review & Mockup</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Merchandisers submit content (product info, pricing, copy)</li>
                                <li>Designers create mockups</li>
                                <li>Stakeholders give feedback in one scheduled, in-person meeting</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Week 2: Finalization</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Only typo-level edits permitted</li>
                                <li>Mockups sent for localization</li>
                                <li>inal assets handed off to developers</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Any feedback outside the proofing tool was no longer accepted—this maintained control and ensured accountability.</p>

                        <li>Identified unnecessary revisions and removed them from future cycles</li>
