                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>During my tenure at Best Buy, I was integral to the UI design, concept development, and production processes. Leveraging tools like Photoshop and Illustrator, I played a key role in creating visually compelling digital newsletters. Collaborating closely with art directors, inventory merchandisers, and product managers, I created impactful promotional content and enhanced the overall <a class="nowarp" href="designprocess.html">design process →</a> for North America’s largest and fastest-growing retail company.</p>

                <h2>Why redesign?</h2>
                <p>As the digital landscape evolved, the need for mobile-friendly design became crucial.</p>
                <p>The existing newsletter, originally crafted for larger screens, faced significant challenges on mobile devices due to its crowded layout, lengthy copy, and small images. These issues hindered user engagement and necessitated a redesign to enhance usability and visual appeal on smaller screens.</p>
